Previous the last uptdate (with new subject) : 11/03/2022
Printf and GNL of the exam02 was moove in the exam03. So, you don't need Union or Inter for the exam03 but I let here.

Last uptdate with new subject and moove of printf and get_next_line : 09/06/2022

For union and get_next_line passed during RealMode exam02 : 100/100. You can trust this repository.
For inter and printf, many tests were done before pushing in this repo. You can do more if you want but I think it's OK.
